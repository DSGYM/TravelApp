# TravelApp

This is the final Udacity Project - a travel app which uses multiple APIs to give the user an idea of what wheather might be when he is going to start his or her trip.

## How to run the project

Use `git clone` to clone the repo

`cd` into the project folder and run `npm install` to install all dependencies

After cloning the repo run `npm i`

4 NPM Scripts are setup:

`npm run build-dev` - Starts the dev server  
`npm run build-prod` - Create the final app inside the dist folder
`npm run test` - runs jest tests 
`npm run start` - starts the node server  


## How to use the app

After running `npm run start` you can access the app at `localhost:8081`
